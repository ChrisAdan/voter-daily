# Good Party Voter Analytics Pipeline

A dbt-powered data transformation pipeline for voter registration and engagement analysis, designed to support Good Party's mission of promoting independent and non-partisan candidates.

## üéØ Project Overview

This pipeline transforms raw voter registration data into analytics-ready tables that support:

- **Partisan trend analysis** across demographics and election cycles
- **Voter engagement segmentation** and re-engagement targeting
- **Geographic and demographic insights** for strategic planning
- **Data quality monitoring** and audit capabilities

## üìä Data Architecture

### Raw Layer (`raw` schema)

- **`vote_records`**: Raw voter registration records from CSV ingestion

### Staging Layer (`stage` schema)

- **`stage_voter_metrics`**: Cleaned voter records with engagement segmentation and derived metrics

### Dimension Layer (`dim` schema)

- **`dim_voter`**: Core voter dimension with demographics and registration history

### Mart Layer (`mart` schema) - Analytics Ready Tables

#### üèõÔ∏è `mart_voter_snapshot`

Current period aggregated voter statistics by demographics.

```sql
-- Example: Get current voter engagement by state and party
select state, party, pct_current_voters, pct_targetable_voters
from mart_voter_snapshot
order by pct_targetable_voters desc;
```

#### üìà `mart_partisan_trends`

Time series analysis of partisan composition across election cycles.

```sql
-- Example: Track Democratic voter participation trends
select election_year, election_type, state, participation_rate
from mart_partisan_trends
where party = 'Democrat' and state = 'PA'
order by election_year desc;
```

#### üéØ `mart_targeting_opportunities`

Ranked demographic segments with highest voter re-engagement potential.

```sql
-- Example: Find top targeting opportunities nationwide
select state, age_group, gender, party, opportunity_score, prime_target_voters
from mart_targeting_opportunities
where targeting_tier = 'High Priority'
order by opportunity_score desc limit 20;
```

#### üó∫Ô∏è `mart_state_summary`

Executive-level state summaries with competitive analysis.

```sql
-- Example: Identify competitive states with high engagement opportunities
select state, partisan_lean, engagement_opportunity_score, total_registered_voters
from mart_state_summary
where partisan_lean in ('Highly Competitive', 'Competitive')
order by engagement_opportunity_score desc;
```

## üìã Key Metrics & Definitions

### Voter Engagement Segments

- **Current Voter**: Participated in most recent election (0 missed)
- **Missed Last Election**: Skipped 1 recent election
- **Occasional Voter**: Missed 2-3 recent elections
- **Infrequent Voter**: Missed 4-6 recent elections
- **Dormant Voter**: Missed 7+ elections
- **Never Voted**: No voting history since registration

### Targeting Tiers

- **High Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•25, segment size ‚â•100 voters
- **Medium Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•15, segment size ‚â•50 voters
- **Low Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•8, segment size ‚â•25 voters
- **Monitor Only**: Below priority thresholds

### Election Types

- **Presidential**: Every 4 years (2024, 2020, 2016...)
- **Midterm**: Even years between presidential (2022, 2018...)
- **Off-Year/Primary**: Odd years and primary elections

## üé® Dashboard Use Cases

### 1. Geographic Strategy Dashboard

Use `mart_state_summary` to identify:

- Competitive states needing attention
- States with high engagement opportunities
- Demographic composition by geography

### 2. Targeting Campaign Dashboard

Use `mart_targeting_opportunities` to:

- Prioritize outreach segments by opportunity score
- Size targeting campaigns by available voters
- Track campaign effectiveness over time

### 3. Partisan Trends Analysis

Use `mart_partisan_trends` to:

- Analyze voter participation shifts over time
- Compare presidential vs midterm engagement patterns
- Identify demographic groups with changing political preferences

### 4. Executive Summary Dashboard

Use `mart_voter_snapshot` for:

- Current period KPIs and voter composition
- High-level engagement metrics
- Snapshot comparisons over time

## üîç Data Quality & Testing

The pipeline includes comprehensive testing:

- **Uniqueness** constraints on voter IDs
- **Referential integrity** between dimension and fact tables
- **Accepted values** validation for categorical fields
- **Date logic** validation (registration before voting)
- **Regex validation** for email formats

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Election Dates

Update the `election_cycles` CTE in `mart_partisan_trends.sql`:

```sql
select '2026-11-03'::date as election_date, 'Midterm' as election_type, 2026 as election_year
```

### Modifying Engagement Segments

Update the logic in `stage_voter_metrics.sql`:

```sql
case
    when elections_since_last_vote = 0 then 'Current Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote = 1 then 'Missed Last Election'
    when elections_since_last_vote between 2 and 3 then 'Occasional Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote between 4 and 6 then 'Infrequent Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote >= 7 then 'Dormant Voter'
    else 'Never Voted'
end as voter_engagement_segment
```

### Adjusting Opportunity Scoring

Modify the scoring weights in `mart_targeting_opportunities.sql`:

```sql
-- Current weights: Recent (40%), Medium (30%), Tenure (20%), Size (10%)
round(
    (40.0 * lapsed_1_election / total_voters) +
    (30.0 * (lapsed_2_3_elections + lapsed_4_6_elections) / total_voters) +
    (20.0 * least(avg_registration_tenure / 10.0, 1.0)) +
    (10.0 * least(total_voters / 1000.0, 1.0))
, 2) as opportunity_score
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Enhanced Election Calendar

- **Dynamic election calendar**: Replace hardcoded dates with external election calendar API
- **State-specific elections**: Include gubernatorial, mayoral, and local elections
- **Primary elections**: Track primary participation patterns
- **Special elections**: Account for off-cycle elections

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics

- **Predictive modeling**: ML models for voter turnout prediction
- **Cohort analysis**: Track voter behavior changes over time
- **Geographic clustering**: Identify similar voting districts for targeted strategies
- **Social network analysis**: Understand voter influence patterns

### Phase 4: Real-time Integration

- **Streaming updates**: Real-time voter registration updates
- **Campaign integration**: Connect with campaign management systems
- **API endpoints**: Expose analytics via REST API for applications
- **Automated alerts**: Notify on significant demographic shifts

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations

- **Incremental models**: Use `{{ incremental_strategy }}` for large tables
- **Partitioning**: Tables partitioned by state and election year where beneficial
- **Indexing**: Key columns indexed for query performance
- **Materialization**: Balanced use of tables vs views based on usage patterns

### Scaling Considerations

```sql
-- Example incremental configuration for large datasets
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='voter_id',
    on_schema_change='fail',
    partition_by=['state', 'election_year']
) }}
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Individual model logic validation
- Edge case handling (null values, date boundaries)
- Data type consistency

### Integration Tests

- Cross-model referential integrity
- Aggregation accuracy between layers
- Historical trend consistency

### Data Quality Tests

```yaml
# Example custom test in schema.yml
tests:
  - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_between:
      arguments:
        column_name: participation_rate
        min_value: 0
        max_value: 100
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Governance

- **PII handling**: Email addresses are the only PII; consider hashing for production
- **Data retention**: Implement retention policies per organizational requirements
- **Access control**: Role-based access to sensitive demographic data
- **Audit logging**: Track all data access and transformations

### Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Right to deletion and data portability
- **CCPA**: California privacy requirements
- **Election law**: Compliance with voter privacy regulations
- **Data sharing**: Restrictions on political data usage
