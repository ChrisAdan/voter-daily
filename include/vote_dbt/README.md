## üìä Data Model Details

![dbt Lineage](docs/lineage.png)

### Core Data Flow

```sql
-- Raw ingestion preserves source fidelity
raw.vote_records (CSV ‚Üí DuckDB)
    ‚Üì
-- Dimension layer ensures data quality
dim_voter (deduped, validated, standardized)
    ‚Üì
-- Staging enriches with analytics fields
stage_voter_metrics (segmentation, tenure, engagement)
    ‚Üì
-- Marts aggregate for business consumption
mart.* (voter_snapshot, partisan_trends, targeting_opportunities, state_summary)
````

### Key Design Decisions

**Incremental Processing**

- `stage_voter_metrics` uses incremental materialization with `voter_id` as unique key
- Processes only new/modified records based on audit timestamps
- Balances freshness with computational efficiency

**Behavioral Segmentation**

- Standardized voter engagement categories based on federal election participation
- Hardcoded election calendar via `simple_elections_since_last_vote` macro
- Current Voter (0 missed) ‚Üí Never Voted (null history)

**Demographic Standardization**

- Age groups aligned with Pew Research political demographic brackets
- Party affiliation simplified to three major categories for analytical clarity
- State-level geographic analysis using standard two-letter codes

## üìã Key Metrics & Definitions

### Voter Engagement Segments

- **Current Voter**: Participated in most recent election (0 missed)
- **Missed Last Election**: Skipped 1 recent election
- **Occasional Voter**: Missed 2-3 recent elections
- **Infrequent Voter**: Missed 4-6 recent elections
- **Dormant Voter**: Missed 7+ elections
- **Never Voted**: No voting history since registration

### Targeting Tiers

- **High Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•25, segment size ‚â•100 voters
- **Medium Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•15, segment size ‚â•50 voters
- **Low Priority**: Opportunity score ‚â•8, segment size ‚â•25 voters
- **Monitor Only**: Below priority thresholds

### Election Types

- **Presidential**: Every 4 years (2024, 2020, 2016...)
- **Midterm**: Even years between presidential (2022, 2018...)
- **Off-Year/Primary**: Odd years and primary elections

## üé® Dashboard Use Cases

### 1. Geographic Strategy Dashboard

Use `mart_state_summary` to identify:

- Competitive states needing attention
- States with high engagement opportunities
- Demographic composition by geography

### 2. Targeting Campaign Dashboard

Use `mart_targeting_opportunities` to:

- Prioritize outreach segments by opportunity score
- Size targeting campaigns by available voters
- Track campaign effectiveness over time

### 3. Partisan Trends Analysis

Use `mart_partisan_trends` to:

- Analyze voter participation shifts over time
- Compare presidential vs midterm engagement patterns
- Identify demographic groups with changing political preferences

### 4. Executive Summary Dashboard

Use `mart_voter_snapshot` for:

- Current period KPIs and voter composition
- High-level engagement metrics
- Snapshot comparisons over time

## üîç Data Quality & Testing

The pipeline includes comprehensive testing:

- **Uniqueness** constraints on voter IDs
- **Referential integrity** between dimension and fact tables
- **Accepted values** validation for categorical fields
- **Date logic** validation (registration before voting)
- **Regex validation** for email formats

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Election Dates

Update the `election_cycles` CTE in `mart_partisan_trends.sql`:

```sql
select '2026-11-03'::date as election_date, 'Midterm' as election_type, 2026 as election_year
```

One enrichment opportunity is to use a public API to integrate a more dynamic, granular election calendar.

### Modifying Engagement Segments

Update the logic in `stage_voter_metrics.sql`:

```sql
case
    when elections_since_last_vote = 0 then 'Current Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote = 1 then 'Missed Last Election'
    when elections_since_last_vote between 2 and 3 then 'Occasional Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote between 4 and 6 then 'Infrequent Voter'
    when elections_since_last_vote >= 7 then 'Dormant Voter'
    else 'Never Voted'
end as voter_engagement_segment
```

### Adjusting Opportunity Scoring

Modify the scoring weights in `mart_targeting_opportunities.sql`:

```sql
-- Current weights: Recent (40%), Medium (30%), Tenure (20%), Size (10%)
round(
    (40.0 * lapsed_1_election / total_voters) +
    (30.0 * (lapsed_2_3_elections + lapsed_4_6_elections) / total_voters) +
    (20.0 * least(avg_registration_tenure / 10.0, 1.0)) +
    (10.0 * least(total_voters / 1000.0, 1.0))
, 2) as opportunity_score
```
